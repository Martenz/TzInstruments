## 3D print setup

+ Printer: Prusa Mini+ 
+ Filament: Filamentum Flex TPU 98A / Prusament PETG
+ Print time: 3h main body / 40 min back cover

#### Why TPU and PETG ?

TPU is a flexible filament with very good resistence to temperature and chemicals, so it is the perfect material for durability. The back cover is printed in PETG an other very resistent material but less flexible to protect the battery and electronics inside.
